## SR_LNLS
SR_LNLS is a matlab(R) code developed during my internship at the [Brazilian Synchrotron](https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/).
The code is based on the following works:
[01] - [KIM, K.-J. (1995). Optical Engineering. 34, 342352](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.194193).
[02] - [TANAKA, T. & KITAMURA, H. (2009). Journal of Synchrotron Radiation. 16, 380386.](https://journals.iucr.org/s/issues/2009/03/00/ie5029/index.html)
[03] - [TANAKA, T. (2014). Physical Review Special Topics - Accelerators and Beams. 17, 060702.](https://journals.aps.org/prab/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.17.060702)

The code has been extensively benchmarked against:
[SRW](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW)
[SPECTRA](http://spectrax.org/spectra/)
